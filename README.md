- mobile apps for Android and iOS for XORX platform operations

Advantages of our trading platform:

- option to switch your exchange accounts with one click 
- option to trade through anonymous account

Staking pool:

- bigger weight of a multi-user joint stake-pool wallet – more awards against solo staking
